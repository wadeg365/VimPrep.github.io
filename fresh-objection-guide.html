            <h2>About Vimeo's Data Platform Modernization</h2>
            <p>Vimeo is looking to modernize their current data platform by migrating from Snowflake to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BigQuery Lakehouse solution. This migration aims to address fundamental issues with their current implementation, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of structure, organization, and governance in the current Snowflake setup</li>
                <li>Distrust in data for asking and answering business questions effectively</li>
                <li>Challenges with self-service analytics capabilities</li>
                <li>Need for improved data governance and quality control</li>

                <h4>Real Scenario from Vimeo:</h4>
                <p>Juliana Wilson, a lead data analyst, described a case where the marketing team was seeing a steady decrease in sign-ups for a subscription tier. This raised alarm bells, and an analytics team spent multiple days investigating, only to discover it wasn't a business problem but a broken data integration upstream from Snowflake.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Our proposal focuses on implementing a GCP BigQuery Lakehouse with a medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold) to improve trust in data and support Vimeo's growth in their enterprise B2B business. The following guide will help you address common objections and concerns that may arise during discussions with Vimeo stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="response">The distrust in your current data isn't primarily a technology issue, but a structural and governance one. Our BigQuery Lakehouse implementation addresses this through a well-defined medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold) with built-in validation at each stage. Unlike your current organic implementation, we'll implement strict data contracts and validation from the earliest point possible – right at the bronze layer ingestion. This ensures data quality issues are caught immediately, rather than propagating through your analytics ecosystem.</p>

                        <li>Our implementation includes schema validation at ingestion to prevent the kind of upstream issues that caused the subscription sign-up reporting problem.</li>

While DataForm doesn't have built-in schema version pointers, we've developed a robust approach that enforces schema validation at the earliest point possible in the bronze layer.

Our approach combines schema validation at ingestion, CI/CD workflow checks, and automated testing. When data is first ingested into the bronze layer, it passes through validation to ensure it meets expected schema and quality requirements. Any transformations to silver and gold layers require passing automated tests that verify the data contract is maintained. This multi-layered approach ensures data contracts are enforced consistently throughout the data lifecycle.</p>

                <p class="response">Unlike Snowflake, our proposed BigQuery Lakehouse architecture is built on open standards and formats. The foundation of our approach is the "Big Lake" solution, which uses the open-source Apache Iceberg table format stored in Google Cloud Storage. This means your data remains accessible through multiple processing engines beyond just BigQuery, including Spark, DataBricks, and others. This architecture simultaneously gives you the performance benefits of BigQuery while mitigating vendor lock-in concerns by keeping your data in open formats.</p>

Our migration approach includes converting your existing dbt macros to DataForm's JavaScript-based include system. We've developed conversion patterns for common dbt patterns that minimize rewriting while maintaining your business logic. Additionally, DataForm offers advantages that dbt doesn't, including tighter integration with BigQuery, real-time compilation and validation, and a more robust workspace isolation model.</p>

                <p class="response">Our architecture provides optimized paths for both hot and cold data processing. For hot path data requiring real-time analytics, we maintain a streaming lane using Dataflow or Pub/Sub that can feed directly into BigQuery's streaming insert API. For cold path batch processing, data flows through Cloud Storage into BigQuery using optimized loading processes. This dual-path approach gives you flexibility while simplifying your architecture. Regarding Kafka, our assessment suggests that for many of your current use cases, it might be adding unnecessary complexity that the native GCP streaming services could handle more efficiently.</p>

Instead of attempting a "big bang" migration, we'll implement a four-step process: 1) Move all data to GCS in the bronze layer first, 2) Build Iceberg tables on top of that data, 3) Connect Snowflake to the Iceberg tables as external tables, and 4) Gradually transition compute capabilities while maintaining existing workflows.

This approach allows you to reduce Snowflake consumption as you incrementally migrate workloads to BigQuery. By year two, we expect to achieve approximately 50% cost reduction compared to your current Snowflake implementation, even accounting for transition costs.
